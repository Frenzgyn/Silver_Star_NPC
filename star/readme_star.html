  <p align="left">SilverStar is an elven assassin who can join the party in Irenicus' 
    lovely underground hole. This project has recently taken a change of direction 
    in that the original creator Davide Carter decided to throw the mod open to 
    the community. Seizing on this chance, the new team have decided to alter 
    several original elements with a view that is seen as more fitting for SilverStar.</p>

  <p align="left"><a name="SS1"></a>Section One - Disclaimers<br>
    First of all, a note on the mods content. Even if we had tried to avoid any 
    mild language this mod contains violent or cruel dialogues. Silver Star is 
    an assassin and she acts of likemind doing things like murdering, stealing 
    kidnapping and so on... If you don't like this kind of behaviour simply say 
    to Silver to cease this things and she will stop after some time.<br>
    If you continue to let her be indulge in her psychotic indulgences then she 
    will probably get worse...<br>
    <br>
    Now a note on the status of the mod in relation to BGII itself - SilverStar 
    is not developed, supported, or endorsed by BioWare or Interplay/Black Isle.<br>

  <p align="left"><a name="SS2"></a>Section Two - Features of the mod<br>
    This is list of what we plan to add or what has already been amended. At the 
    time of updating this mod and disposing of the irrelevent matters, I have 
    pushed several of these to the sidelines. Give me enough time and they will 
    be added again.<br>

    <font color="#000000"><a name="SS4"></a>Section Four - Thanks and Credits</font></font></p>
  <p align="center"><font color="#000000">Special Thanks to the following </font></p>
  <p align="center"><font color="#000000">Davide Carta - For starting the concept and allowing it to be developed without his future guidance. We've done what we can with the mod and hope it honours both what he had in mind and what people may have been expecting of the original.<br>
    Diana - When my own personal life &quot;hit the fan&quot; Diana continued the development and the coding of the mod as my attentions and efforts were elsewhere. She took it upon her herself to fix bugs that I'd missed as well as adding additional material. She also saw fit to beta test on her own before sending the material onto the gang. The mod owes her much. <br>
    Dancer Fitz - One of the mainstays of the team in that she has submitted and written vast amounts of banter, dialogue, ideas and so on for this mod. We also owe her a lot for improving the standard of English vastly from Davide's original version (he was an Italian native). Her own impact cannot be fairly assessed but its all appreciated.<br>
    TGM- for his balancing perspectives and occasional plot suggestions.  The number of disagreements and heated exchanges we had in the private forum vary but his help and insight have always been appreciated. <br>
    St. Jo - For adding her strong, beautiful voice to Silver Star. This was never an easy one to act out but she did it superbly.<br> 
    </font></p>

    </font></font>Ryan (aka, Wizard of Thay)for his help in the correction of 
    english and for the long comments to each dialogue and the suggestions for

    Erik Manning (Icelus) for discovering how to add the infamous HTML readme file!<br>
